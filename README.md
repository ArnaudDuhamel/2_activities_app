# Sample Android app naviguating between 2 activities

This application is based on the tutorial at this link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/start-a-new-activity-using-intent-in-android-using-jetpack-compose/

The Intent mechanism used in this application is not the proper one to naviguate between two pages of the same application. 
It is meant to navigate between two different applications. It nonetheless does the job here.

The code was updated to the latest versions.

The repository can be cloned and it should work out of the box as of October 1, 2023 by running it in Android Studio.

## Context

This application was created in connection with the course mobile programming in the bachelor of programming at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, cohort 2021.
